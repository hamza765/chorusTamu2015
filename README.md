##Currently an Android acapella app where you can record four individual sounds/lines and then play them all at once.

**Original idea:**
*Crowdsourcing music*

Basically, you would go into the app, click create new song, choose `song` or `acapella`, and then record the first line of a song. It could either be a random line you just made up, or it could be the the first line of a song to which we'd provide the lyrics. After recording has finished, you would release it back to the network so that someone else could sing the next line. 

After a while, you would have a complete song. You could then apply beats or similar filters and you would have a finished song.

If you went the acapella route, the end product would just be all the sounds compiled into one.
